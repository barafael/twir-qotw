<h1>Quotes of all the Weeks</h1>
<h2>content/2020-04-07-this-week-in-rust.md</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, it is possible to completely rearchitect the underlying code while leaving the public API as-is, and without introducing new bugs. I've literally never had such a liberating experience with refactoring until Rust.</p>
<p>In other words, I have never been so productive in any other language. Dynamic languages like JavaScript and Python are the least productive <em>by far</em>. Code runs, tests pass, put it into production and... uncaught exception! Time to rollback and redo that whole dance <strong>AGAIN</strong>. With Rust, we take care of all of that crap while actually writing the code the first time. No more surprise 3am wake up calls. <em>That</em> is productivity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meta-Comment: I started this topic as someone completely uninvolved in the rust project. It's very reassuring seeing the nature of the response. Even knowing how fantastic the Rust community is, I was still prepared to be met with at least a small element of condescension given the nature of this issue. I haven't felt any sense of it. It's amazing. Anyone that has impact on the community culture deserves credit: This sort of experience doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from a long history of many people nudging things in the right direction.
Thank you.</p>

<p>As part of this work, I even found two memory safety bugs in the DRM scheduler component that were causing kernel oopses for Alyssa and other developers, so the Rust driver work also benefits other kernel drivers that use this shared code! Meanwhile, I still haven't gotten any reports of kernel oopses due to bugs in the Rust code at all.</p>

<p>This time we had two very good quotes, I could not decide, so here are both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I have been learning ... was not Rust in particular, but how to write sound software in general, and that in my opinion is the largest asset that the rust community tough me, through the language and tools that you developed.</p>
<p>Under this prism, it was really easy for me to justify the step learning curve that Rust offers: I wanted to learn how to write sound software, writing sound software is really hard , and the Rust compiler is a really good teacher.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This ability to identify unsound code transcends Rust's language, and in my opinion is heavily under-represented in most cost-benefit analysis over learning Rust or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a fast language is not enough (ASM), and having a language with strong type guarantees neither (Haskell), and having a language with ease of use and portability also neither (Python/Java). Combine all of them together, and you get the best of all these worlds.</p>
<p>Rust is not the best option for any coding philosophy, it’s the option that is currently the best at combining all these philosophies.</p>

<p>This week we have two (related) quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version.</strong> This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go.</p>
<p>[..] After a bit of profiling and performance optimizations, <strong>we were able to beat Go on every single performance metric</strong> . Latency, CPU, and memory were all better in the Rust version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The consistency angle really shouldn’t be overlooked. Performance is nice, but slow and consistent can still be planned for much more easily than inconsistent.</p>
<p>That was the big aha moment about Rust for me when I pushed out my first project using the language. Being nervous about it I had added way too much instrumentation so that I could know how every bit of it was responding to real traffic. But as soon as I started seeing the data, I was convinced that my instrumentation code was broken. The graphs I was seeing were just so...boring. Straight lines everywhere, no variation...after 24hrs, the slowest response (not P99...literally P100) was within 75ms of the fastest response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the security of the internet is incredibly important obviously and I want it to be secure and I think bringing rust there is absolutely going to help it. Just by default it eliminates some of the most classic types of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>But I don't think that's the most exciting part. I think the most exciting part is that the set of people for whom it is possible to implement these types of things, like who writes coreutils, who writes curl, who does those things. That used to be a really small pool of people. That had to be people who knew the dark arts, and only them and only their buddies or something.</p>
<p><strong>And it's the goal of rust to empower that to be a larger group of people</strong> and ultimately I think that that is what is going to happen which means the sheer number of people will be larger, and also the diversity of that set of people is going to grow. And I that that that will probably actually do more for the security and usefulness of these tools than eliminating undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>I wrote a bespoke time-series database in Rust a few years ago, and it has had exactly one issue since I stood it up in production, and that was due to pessimistic filesystem access patterns, rather than the language. This thing is handling hundreds of thousands of inserts per second, and it's even threaded.</p>
<p>Given that I've been programming professionally for over a decade in Python, Perl, Ruby, C, C++, Javascript, Java, and Rust, I'll pick Rust absolutely any time that I want something running that I won't get called at 3 AM to fix. It probably took me 5 times as long to write it as if I did it in Go or Python, but I guarantee it's saved me 10 times as much time I would have otherwise spent triaging, debugging, and running disaster recovery.</p>

<p>C++ being memory safe is like saying riding a motorcycle is crash safe.</p>
<p>It totally is, if you happen to have the knowledge and experience to realize this is only true if you remember to put on body-armor, a helmet, a full set of leathers including gloves and reinforced boots, and then remember to operate the motorcycle correctly afterwards. In C/C++ though, that armor is completely 100% optional.</p>

<p>I guess the nicest example of this phenomenon is shared mutability. Programmers have been arguing for decades whether it is sharing xor mutability that causes memory safety bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It's threads!" – shouted JavaScript and Python, and JS remained single-threaded, and Python introduced the GIL.</li>
<li>"It's mutability!" – screamed Haskell and Erlang, and they made (almost) everything immutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then along came Rust, and said: "you are fools! You can have both sharing and mutability in the same language, as long as you isolate them from each other."</p>

<p>The whole motivation behind exceptions is to allow one to write ones business logic, concentrate on what one likes to think ones program will do, without having lots of fiddly error checking and handling code obscuring that logic. Error situations are therefore swept under the carpet with "try" and kept out of sight with "catch".</p>
<p>However in my world view failure is not exceptional, it is a common happening, it's too important to be hidden away. Therefor failure handling should be in ones face in the code you write. Certainly in the face of those that read it.</p>

<p>I've seen similar sentiments echoed before, elsewhere. The point it's making is the same one that's argued whenever people say you should learn LISP because it'll make you a better programmer.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a perfectly intuitive programming language because algorithmic thinking isn't something that comes to us intuitively. That's why the first language is always the hardest.</p>
<p>It's helpful and mind-expanding to learn new paradigms and force yourself out of old cognitive ruts. Thus, from an "improving your ability to solve problems and function as a programmer" perspective, what makes Rust difficult is valuable because it's forcing you to learn to think about problems in new ways.</p>
<p>That's the distinction between necessary complexity and complexity due to ill-considered design. (Similar to how, in video games, there's a difference between genuine difficulty and difficulty caused by something like a crappy control scheme.)</p>

<p>For some weird reason the Elixir Discord community has a distinct lack of programmer-socks-wearing queer furries, at least compared to Rust, or even most other tech-y Discord servers I’ve seen. It caused some weird cognitive dissonance. Why do I feel vaguely strange hanging out online with all these kind, knowledgeable, friendly and compassionate techbro’s? Then I see a name I recognized from elsewhere and my hindbrain goes “oh thank gods, I know for a fact she’s actually a snow leopard in her free time”. Okay, this nitpick is firmly tongue-in-cheek, but the Rust user-base continues to be a fascinating case study in how many weirdos you can get together in one place when you very explicitly say it’s ok to be a weirdo.</p>

<p>On the topic of reframing UB, I was reminded of an article about the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/28/collections-oaths-how-do-they-work/">mechanics of oaths and vows in historical cultures</a>.</p>
<p>When a programmer writes <code>get_unchecked</code> , we can imagine them wanting to promise the compiler that they uphold its preconditions. But since the compiler is normally not so trusting of unproven assertions, the programmer swears an <em>oath</em> that their argument is in bounds.</p>
<p>The compiler, seeing such a solemn commitment, treats the programmer's word as true and optimizes accordingly. The compiler is so thoroughly convinced that it never even entertains the possibility of doubting the programmer's oath.</p>
<p>But if the programmer has sworn falsely, then they might well suffer divine retribution in the form of nasal demons — or worse, subtly baffling program behaviour.</p>

<p>Rust is funny because in one sense it's hard and clunky. However, it's only ever <em>precisely as hard and clunky as it needs to be</em>. Everywhere something can be made more concise, or readable, or convenient, without sacrificing any control, it has been. Anytime something is hard or inconvenient, it's because the underlying domain really is exactly that hard or inconvenient.</p>
<p>Contrast this with other languages, which are often clunky when they don't need to be and/or "easy" when they shouldn't be.</p>

<p>Borrow/lifetime errors are usually Rust compiler bugs.
Typically, I will spend 20 minutes detailing the precise conditions of
the bug, using language that understates my immense knowledge, while
demonstrating sympathetic understanding of the pressures placed on a
Rust compiler developer, who is also probably studying for several exams
at the moment. The developer reading my bug report may not understand
this stuff as well as I do, so I will carefully trace the lifetimes of
each variable, where memory is allocated on the stack vs the heap, which
struct or function owns a value at any point in time, where borrows
begin and where they... oh yeah, actually that variable really doesn't
live long enough.</p>

<p>It took me sometime to let go and embrace getting things working before optimizing. It was a major breakthrough on that journey when I realized that ALL my python variables are <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> , so any chance I had to make a variable that was less complicated than that was already a big optimization. If 1/10 Rust variables had to be that complicated it would not feel good, but it would already be 90% better. So if 1/50 make the code ezere to read and maintain then do it!</p>

<p>[W]e reached a tipping point. <strong>We decided to move our entire codebase to Rust</strong>... . Rust seemed to give us all the capabilities we needed, <strong>however, there was still one <em>minor</em> problem - no one on the team knew Rust.</strong> ...</p>
<p>We started with a small team of senior engineers and managers learning Rust and developing the skeleton of the DB and dev environment (for others to build on). Then, slowly, others joined in rewriting and contributing different components until we eventually got rid of the old codebase altogether (I still remember the day my original C modules, from the first days of Pinecone, were taken out). Unbeknownst to most Pinecone customers, the new Rust core was deployed in March this year. And in the process of taking over running workloads, we managed not to drop a single API call!</p>
<p>... <strong>We all expect[ed] performance and dev processes to improve. Those indeed happened.</strong> What we didn’t expect was the extent to which dev velocity increased and operational incidents decreased. <strong>Dev velocity</strong> ... <strong>improved dramatically with Rust. Built-in testing, CI/CD, benchmarking, and an overzealous compiler increased engineers’ confidence in pushing changes, and enabled them to work on the same code sections and contribute simultaneously without breaking the code base.</strong> Most impressively though, <strong>real time operational events dropped almost to zero overnight after the original release.</strong> Sure, there are still surprises here and there but, by and large, the core engine has been shockingly stable and predictable.</p>

<p>People argue about the color of a bike shed because even though it's a meaningless decision - it's still a decision that has to be made. The null choice is a very bad choice - if you don't paint the shed it'll rust. And there is no "default color" so you can't just say "just color it" - you have to pick a color.</p>
<p>Even seen someone argue about the <strong>pattern</strong> of the shed's paint? No. The pattern is not any more meaningful than the color, but unlike the color - there is a null choice. There is a default. Solid paint. And because there is a default, no one even thinks about using something else because why are you wasting company time and money on a pattern for a bike shed?</p>
<p>From my personal experience, when there is a default and the default is good enough, nobody bikesheds how to derive from the default. They only discuss it when there is a concrete problem with the default, where is doesn't fit your needs for whatever reason. And when you do have a concrete reason to derive from the default - you will derive from the default. Because you have to. And if the library does not support it - you'll switch the library.</p>
<p>Because you have to.</p>

<p>Have you seen someone juggle several items with one hand? That's the point of async. Blocking (non-async) it like writing - it requires constant work from each hand. If you want to write twice as fast you'll need two hands and write with both at the same time. That's multithreading. If you juggle, the moment the item leaves your hand and is in the air, you have it left with nothing to do. That's similar to network IO - you make a request and are just waiting for the server to respond. You could be doing something in the meantime, like catching another item and throwing it back up again. That's what "await" does - it says I threw and item into the air, so I want my current thread / hand to switch over to catch something else now.</p>

<p>Say the same thing about seatbelts in a car. If you don’t plan to have accidents, why do you need seatbelts?</p>
<p>Car accidents, like mistakes in programming are a risk that has a likelihood that is non-zero. A seatbelt might be a little bit annoying when things go well, but much less so when they don’t. Rust is there to stop you in most cases when you try to accidentally shot yourself into the leg, unless you deliberately without knowing what you are doing while yelling “hold my beer” (unsafe). And contrary to popular belief even in unsafe blocks many of Rust’s safety guarantees hold, just not all.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Just like with the seatbelt, there will be always those that don’t wear one for their very subjective reasons (e.g. because of edge cases where a seatbelt could trap you in a burning car, or because it is not cool, or because they hate the feeling and think accidents only happen to people who can’t drive).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust has multiple <em>unique</em> paradigms that don't even exist in other languages, such as lifetimes and compile-time-tracked "exclusive access". But instead of endorsing them from the beginning, as @mbrubeck's <a href="https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2019/02/07/rust-a-unique-perspective.html"> <em>Rust: a unique perspective</em> </a> does, the Rust book tries to show a language that is "like other languages, but with (magical) compile-time checks". When the truth is that Rust's strength lies in non-<code>unsafe</code> Rust being <strong>less expressive</strong> than languages like C or C++.</p>
<p>I think that Rust should start with the statement: "Welcome to a language that by being less expressive forces you to use constructs that are <strong>guaranteed at compile-time to be sound</strong>. But don't worry; after some time you will get used to the coding patterns that are allowed, and will then almost not notice the hindered expressiveness, only the enhanced zero-cost safety that will let you <strong>hack without fear</strong>."</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't sound bad imho, and is at least honest <em>w.r.t.</em> the struggles that someone refusing to shift their way of coding / mental coding patterns may encounter.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>One reason we keep certain things as hard errors rather than lints: it establishes a baseline
that you can safely assume about other people's code, since it can't be turned off. And as a
result, that baseline can become part of people's mental model of Rust itself, rather than
something that might or might not be true in any given codebase.</p>
<p>We have to take care to not use that lightly, because that places work on all users of Rust to
maintain code to that baseline. But there are cases where we do. We don't allow using one integer
type where another was expected. We don't allow certain operations outside an unsafe block. ...</p>
<p>I think the standard we should apply is asking whether something is part of the baseline that
people should be able to assume about all Rust code, and if that's worth the tradeoff of requiring
that baseline of all Rust users.</p>

<p>Rust is a very different beast for me. It is a <em>much</em> bigger and <em>much</em> more capable language.

<p>Just the presence of well integrated Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) makes an incredible amount of difference. They are used to represent errors in a meaningful and easy to understand way (<code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code>), are used to show that a function may or may not return a meaningful value without needing a garbage value (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>), and the optional case can even be used to wrap a null pointer scenario in a safe way (<code>Option&lt;Ref&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> being the closest to a literal translation I think).</p>
<p>That’s just one small feature that permeates the language. Whatever the opposite of a death-of-a-thousand-cuts is, Rust has it.</p>

In this perfect utopia you have invented the perfect model for managing your computer's sci-fi hardware, perfectly free from the legacy of Unix and Windows. And you need the perfect language to write it in. Everywhere you look is legacy: C, C++, Java; the stacks get bigger and bigger, cruft all the way down.</p>

For your ambitions, Rust is the only reasonable choice in a world filled with compromises.</p>

<p>I really hate the phrase "fighting". Calling it a fight doesn't do justice to the conversations you have with the borrow checker when you use Rust every day. You don't fight with the borrow checker, because there isn't a fight to win. It's far more elegant, more precise. It's fencing; you fence with the borrow checker, with ripostes and parries and well-aimed thrusts. And sometimes, you get to the end and you realize you lose anyway because the thing you were trying to do was fundamentally wrong. And it's okay, because it's just fencing, and you're a little wiser, a little better-honed, a little more practiced for your next bout.</p>

<p>I recently graduated with my Ph.D., after having worked on 5 different versions of my simulator, written in 4 different languages. The last version, written in pure, safe rust, worked correctly in part because of rust's strong guarantees about what 'safety' means, which I was able to leverage to turn what would normally be runtime errors into compile time errors. That let me catch errors that would normally be days or weeks of debugging into relatively simple corrections. [...] So, once again, thank you to everyone!</p>

<p>After doing a best fit, we found Rust projects were less likely to introduce vulnerabilities than their equivalent C++ projects at all relevant experience levels, but more importantly, we found the effect was most significant for first-time contributors, who were almost two orders of magnitude less likely to contribute vulnerabilities. That is, even though Rust may have a reputation as a harder language to learn, there is a very measurable effect that makes it better for newbies. Reviewers should not have to put as much effort into reviewing code to be confident that someone making their first foray into their project is accidentally adding a vulnerability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust has demonstrated that you using a type system as a vehicle for separation logic works, even in imperative languages, and it's nothing as arcane as those immutable functional predecessors would suggest. It did this by making sure the language defines a type system that helps you, by making sure core properties of soundness <em>can</em> be expressed in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>soundness requirement for memory access: lifetimes</li>
<li>soundness requirements for references <em>with</em> value semantics: &gt; <code>&amp;</code>/<code>&amp;mut _</code></li>
<li>soundness requirements for resources: <code>Copy</code> and <code>Drop</code></li>
<li>making sure your logic is monotic: traits instead of inheritance, lack of specialization (yes, that's a <em>feature</em>).</li>
<li>(notably missing: no dependent types; apparently not 'necessary' but I'm sure it could be useful; however, research is heavily ongoing; caution is good)</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows the standard library to encode all of its relevant requirements as types. And doing this everywhere is its soundness property: safe functions have no requirements beyond the sum of its parameter type, <code>unsafe functions</code> can. Nothing new or special there, nothing that makes Rust's notion of soundness special.</p>
<p>Basing your mathematical reasoning on separation logic makes soundness reviews <em>local</em> instead of requiring whole program analysis. This is what makes it practical. It did this pretty successfully and principled, but did no single truly revolutionary thing. It's a sum of good bits from the last decade of type system research. That's probably why people refer to it as 'the soundness definition', it's just a very poignant way to say: "we learned that a practical type systems works as a proof checker".</p>

<p>Rusts standard library, and a lot of the popular crates, are like a museum. While it does change, as new exhibitions are added, it is mostly finished. Each painting has a detailed explanation in 7 different languages underneath. Descriptions below each excitation are written beautifully, with detailed drawings, showing how everything works. It is so easy to navigate, one glance at the map is enough to find exactly what you are looking for. It is so convenient, you almost don't notice that you are learning something.</p>
<p>Internals of <code>rustc</code> are like a build site of a sprawling factory. You can see the scaffolds everywhere, as more production lines come online, and everything gets faster, better, bigger. Workers move around, knowing the place like the back of their hands. They can glance at the signs on the walls, and instantly tell you: where you are, what this place does and what pitfalls you should avoid. And you are a new hire who has just came for his first day at the new job. You look at the sign, and after some thinking, you too are able to tell roughly in which building you are. The signs almost always tell you what you need, just in short, cryptic sentences. You always can tell what is going on, with some thinking, but it is not effortless. The signs on the walls are not <em>bad</em>, just not written for anyone to get right away.</p>

Most experienced Rust developers know exactly how to model their code in a way that no time is wasted fighting the compiler on design issues, and can spot anti-patterns at a glance, just like most people know how to drive their car on the correct side of the road to avoid accidents, and notice those who don’t!</p>

<p>As the tradeoffs in software engineering change over time, so does the ideal solution. Some 40 years ago when the first C standards were written down, by people no less competent than those that work on Rust today, the design of the language and the list of behaviours not defined likely made much more sense in context of back then than they do right now. It is not all that unlikely that some years down the line the choices made by Rust won't make all that much of sense as they do today, too.</p>

<h1>Bastion of the Turbofish</h1>
<p>Beware travellers, lest you venture into waters callous and unforgiving, where hope must abandoned, ere it is cruelly torn from you. For here stands the bastion of the Turbofish: an impenetrable fortress holding unshaking against those who would dare suggest the supererogation of the Turbofish.</p>
<p>Once I was young and foolish and had the impudence to imagine that I could shake free from the coils by which that creature had us tightly bound. I dared to suggest that there was a better way: a brighter future, in which Rustaceans both new and old could be rid of that vile beast. But alas! In my foolhardiness my ignorance was unveiled and my dreams were dashed unforgivingly against the rock of syntactic ambiguity.</p>
<p>This humble program, small and insignificant though it might seem, demonstrates that to which we had previously cast a blind eye: an ambiguity in permitting generic arguments to be provided without the consent of the Great Turbofish. Should you be so naïve as to try to revolt against its mighty clutches, here shall its wrath be indomitably displayed. This program must pass for all eternity, fundamentally at odds with an impetuous rebellion against the Turbofish.</p>
<p>My heart aches in sorrow, for I know I am defeated. Let this be a warning to all those who come after. Here stands the bastion of the Turbofish.</p>

<p>Since it hasn't been said before, there is an important distinction that needs to be addressed. For anyone who has been doing embedded work for any length of time and hasn't yet been exposed to Rust, the only thing that can really be said is that the language is entirely unlike everything you've experienced before. There is just nothing comparable, and the only way to rationalize questions like <em>why use Rust at all</em> is to put some honest effort into learning and using it.</p>
<p>Hearing things like "it's a bit like C++ except it's memory safe and thread safe, and it's actually practical to build kernels with it" will not sound convincing. You have to see it to believe it.</p>

<p>If manually managing memory is like wielding a gun, the borrow checker is an automatic safety that prevents you from pulling the trigger when you're roughly pointing it at yourself. But it's coarse-grained and errs on the side of caution; it simulates your foot as as the rectangular box that would contain it, not as a detailed 3D mesh. If you <em>really</em> think you can aim it between your toes and avoid hitting yourself (for example, "the value returned by this function must remain alive for no more than 15 successive invocations of this function"), unsafe will let you try, but the borrow checker's built-in rules isn't granular enough to help you, though it will still stop you if you accidentally put your hand in front without declaring it.</p>

<p>If you stabilise Try{From,Into}, you also want implementations of the types in std. So you want things like impl TryFrom<u8> for u16. But that requires an error type, and that was (I believe) the problem.</p>
<p>u8 to u16 cannot fail, so you want the error type to be !. Except using ! as a type isn’t stable yet. So use a placeholder enum! But that means that once ! is stabilised, we’ve got this Infallible type kicking around that is redundant. So change it? But that would be breaking. So make the two isomorphic? Woah, woah, hold on there, this is starting to get crazy…</p>
<p><em>new person bursts into the room</em> “Hey, should ! automatically implement all traits, or not?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” “No!” “Yes, and so should all variant-less enums!”</p>
<p>Everyone in the room is shouting, and the curtains spontaneously catching fire. In the corner, the person who proposed Try{From,Into} sits, sobbing. It was supposed to all be so simple… but this damn ! thing is just ruining everything.</p>
<p>… That’s not what happened, but it’s more entertaining than just saying “many people were unsure exactly what to do about the ! situation, which turned out to be more complicated than expected”.</p>

<p>At Cloudflare we have big Rust projects/teams and onboard new developers regularly.</p>
<p>There is a learning curve. Rust is rigid and unforgiving, and noobs need assistance when the compiler says “no” (although error messages and Clippy do a good job for common mistakes).</p>
<p>However, the big upside is that noobs can contribute safely to Rust projects. Rust limits severity of the damage an inexperienced programmer can cause. Once they manage to get the code to compile, it already has lots of correctness guarantees. “Bad” Rust code may just clone more than strictly necessary, or write 10 lines of code for something that has a helper method in the stdlib, but it won’t corrupt memory or blindly run the happy path without checking for errors. Rust prefers to be locally explicit, so it’s also easy to review.</p>

<p>References are a sharp tool and there are roughly three different approaches to sharp tools.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't give programmers sharp tools. They may make mistakes and cut their fingers off. <em>This is the Java/Python/Perl/Ruby/PHP... approach.</em></li>
<li>Give programmers all the sharp tools they want. They are professionals and if they cut their fingers off it's their own fault. <em>This is the C/C++ approach.</em></li>
<li>Give programmers sharp tools, but put guards on them so they can't accidentally cut their fingers off. <em>This is Rust's approach.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Lifetime annotations are a safety guard on references. Rust's references have no sychronization and no reference counting -- that's what makes them sharp. References in category-1 languages (which typically <em>do</em> have synchronization and reference counting) are "blunted": they're not really <em>quite</em> as effective as category-2 and -3 references, but they don't cut you, and they still work; they might just slow you down a bit.</p>
<p>So, frankly, I like lifetime annotations because they prevent me from cutting my fingers off.</p>

<p>Right.  I've never even used this impl, but my first thought upon seeing the question "I have an <code>Iterator</code> of <code>X</code> and need a <code>Y</code>" was to look at the <code>FromIterator</code> impls of <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>If that impl <em>didn't</em> exist, I'd then look for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other <code>FromIterator&lt;X&gt;</code> impls for <code>String</code> to see if any of those <code>X</code> can easily be produced from <code>char</code> (and then I would call <code>map</code> before <code>.collect()</code>).</li>
<li><code>impl FromIterator&lt;char&gt; for Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>.  If this existed I would use <code>String::from_utf8(iterator.collect())</code>.</li>
<li><code>impl Add&lt;char&gt; for String</code>.  If this existed, I would use <code>.fold(String::new(), |s, c| s + c)</code></li>
<li>methods of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html">char</a> to see if there's anything that lets you obtain the UTF8 bytes.  Indeed, there is <code>encode_utf8</code>, which even gives a <code>&amp;mut str</code>, so one can write
<pre><code class="language-rust">.fold(String::new(), |s, c| {
    let mut buffer = [u8; 4];
    s += &amp;*c.encode_utf8(&amp;mut buffer);

<p>My take on this is that you cannot use async Rust correctly and fluently without understanding Arc, Mutex, the mutability of variables/references, and how async and await syntax compiles in the end. Rust forces you to understand how and why things are the way they are. It gives you minimal abstraction to do things that could’ve been tedious to do yourself.</p>
<p>I got a chance to work on two projects that drastically forced me to understand how async/await works. The first one is to transform a library that is completely sync and only requires a sync trait to talk to the outside service. This all sounds fine, right? Well, this becomes a problem when we try to port it into browsers. The browser is single-threaded and cannot block the JavaScript runtime at all! It is arguably the most weird environment for Rust users. It is simply impossible to rewrite the whole library, as it has already been shipped to production on other platforms.</p>
<p>What we did instead was rewrite the network part using async syntax, but using our own generator. The idea is simple: the generator produces a future when called, and the produced future can be awaited. But! The produced future contains an arc pointer to the generator. That means we can feed the generator the value we are waiting for, then the caller who holds the reference to the generator can feed the result back to the function and resume it. For the browser, we use the native browser API to derive the network communications; for other platforms, we just use regular blocking network calls. The external interface remains unchanged for other platforms.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t think any other language out there could possibly do this. Maybe C or C++, but which will never have the same development speed and developer experience.</p>
<p>I believe people have already mentioned it, but the current asynchronous model of Rust is the most reasonable choice. It does create pain for developers, but on the other hand, there is no better asynchronous model for Embedded or WebAssembly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's a common trope among people unfamiliar with rust where they assume that if you use unsafe at all, then it's just as unsafe as C and rust provided no benefit. Comparing C's approach to safety vs Rust's is like comparing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open world assumption</a> to a closed world assumption in formal logic systems. In C, you publish your api if it's possible to use correctly (open world). In Rust, you publish a safe api if it's <strong>im</strong> possible to use <strong>in</strong> correctly (closed world). Rust's key innovation here is that it enables you to build a 'bridge' from open world (unsafe) to a closed world (safe), a seemingly impossible feat that feels like somehow pairwise reducing an uncountable infinity with a countable infinity. Rust's decision to design an analogous closed-world assumption for safe code is extremely powerful, but it seems very hard for old school C programmers to wrap their head around it.</p>

<p>There actually are NOT very many places where the C code’s behavior conflicts with Rust’s borrowing rules. This is both somewhat surprising, because there’s no way this code was written with Rust’s borrowing semantics in mind, and also entirely sensible, since Rust’s borrowing semantics are often quite close to how you actually want your code to behave anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The design of the safe/unsafe split means that there is an asymmetric trust relationship between Safe and Unsafe Rust. Safe Rust inherently has to trust that any Unsafe Rust it touches has been written correctly. On the other hand, Unsafe Rust cannot trust Safe Rust without care.</p>
<p>As an example, Rust has the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html"><code>PartialOrd</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html"><code>Ord</code></a> traits to differentiate between types which can "just" be compared, and those that provide a "total" ordering (which basically means that comparison behaves reasonably).</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html"><code>BTreeMap</code></a> doesn't really make sense for partially-ordered types, and so it requires that its keys implement <code>Ord</code> . However, <code>BTreeMap</code> has Unsafe Rust code inside of its implementation. Because it would be unacceptable for a sloppy <code>Ord</code> implementation (which is Safe to write) to cause Undefined Behavior, the Unsafe code in BTreeMap must be written to be robust against <code>Ord</code> implementations which aren't actually total — even though that's the whole point of requiring <code>Ord</code> .</p>

It’s incredibly hard to do things that you should be able to do in software. And, it’s a huge problem for me to constantly be helping other engineers debug the same bugs over and over. It’s always another use after free. I’ve probably debugged 300 of those. [...]</p>
<p>In our experience using the Rust ecosystem for almost three years now, I don't think we found a bug in a single Rust crate that we've pulled off the shelf. We found a bug in one of them and that was a Rust crate wrapping a C library and the bug was in the C library. The software quality that you kind of get for free is amazing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because lower-level software has more operational constraints than higher-level software (e.g. it typically cannot tolerate a runtime or memory management via garbage collection), developing a memory safe language suitable for systems software is particularly challenging. The Rust language has met that challenge, however, and is an excellent candidate for replacing C in many systems applications.</p>
<p>We plan to invest in the tools that allow systems engineers to move their software to Rust. This means investing in improving package management, compilers, and Foreign Function Interface (FFI) generators. In many cases this will include providing interfaces compatible with existing widely-used components to enable transition. With these tools, adoption of a memory safe alternative will scale much faster without replication of efforts.</p>

<p>Regarding the C++ discussion, when I started programming the only viable oss version control system was cvs. It was horrible, but better than nothing. Then subversion was created and it was like a breath of fresh air, because it did the same thing well. Then alternatives exploded and among them git emerged as this amazing, amazing game-changer because it changed the whole approach to version control, enabling amazing things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it was that very event that lent the world to ruin...</p>
<p>It had been decades since the last line of C code was erased, and the last C compiler (written, ironically (but unsurprisingly), in Rust) engraved onto a golden disc and launched toward that distant star around which the GooglePepsiMusk Sphere's construction could be faintly observed. To even utter that fell syllable would be met with swift retaliation from the paramilitary <em>Borrow Xekkers</em> (the alphabet as well having been altered to better suit this shining memory-safe utopia). The whole world, everything, had all been rewritten in Rust, and at last the world knew universal peace and prosperity of boundless proportion.</p>
<p>But something stirred... a prophecy ancient in origin. <strong>The Second.0 Coming</strong>. And when realized at last, the world was divided between the forward-thinking devotees of <em>Rust Two-Point-Oh</em> and those vainly clinging to <em>Rust One-Point-Four-Hundred-And-Seventeen</em>.</p>
<p>And thus did The Great Schism rend interstellar civilization in twain.</p>
<p>There was but one ray of hope. As the fires of war rushed toward the newly-completed GooglePepsiMusk Sphere, its cadre of elite 10<sup>10x</sup> programmers set to work. Their task: to write the most advanced compound artificial intelligence ever known, one capable of averting the catastrophe consuming the universe: <em>AlexKryton.exe</em><sup>[1]</sup> . Due to Rust's incredible productivity benefits, they completed their task in a mere 22 seconds--and thanks to the Rust compiler's incredible performance, spent only nine months waiting for it compile. Using the artificial black hole at the center of the GPMS, and with only moments to spare, they sent their AI back in time, to the era of Rust's birth: 2011.</p>
<p>That's the whole story. And yet those perceptible among you may ask: "<em>which version of Rust did they use?!</em>" Alex alone knows...</p>
<p><sub>[1] Yeah, Windows won. Sorry.</sub></p>

<p>The Tianyi-33 satellite is a 50kg class space science experimental satellite equipped with an operating system independently developed by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications—the Rust-based dual-kernel real-time operating system <strong>RROS</strong>. RROS will carry out general tasks represented by tensorflow/k8s and real-time tasks represented by real-time file systems and real-time network transmission on the satellite. It will ensure the normal execution of upper-layer applications and scientific research tasks, such as time-delay measurement between satellite and ground, live video broadcasting, onboard web chat services, pseudo-SSH experiments, etc. This marks the world’s first official application of a Rust-written dual-kernel operating system in a satellite scenario.</p>

<p>It's very much a positive feedback loop: good tooling makes good tooling easier to build, so more of it gets built and the cycle repeats.
<code>cargo-semver-checks</code> stands on the shoulders of giants like <code>rustc</code> and <code>rustdoc</code> and <a href="https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall">Trustfall</a>. Remove any one of them (or even just <code>rustc</code>'s high-quality diagnostics!) and <code>cargo-semver-checks</code> wouldn't have been a viable project at all.</p>

<p>And even if you could fix all of rustc's soundness holes, or otherwise prevent user code from
exploiting them, a soundness bug in any third-party library can also make it possible for
malicious crates to trigger arbitrary behavior from safe code.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>This is why we need to emphasize that while Rust's static analyses are very good at limiting
accidental vulnerabilties in non-malicious code, they are not a sandbox system that can place
meaningful limits on malicious code.</p>

<p>The sheer stability of this program is what made me use rust for everything going forward. The social-service has a 100% uptime for almost 2.5 years now. It’s processed 12.9TB of traffic and is still using 1.5mb of ram just like the day we ran it 2.5 years ago. The resource usage is so low it brings tears to my eyes. As someone who came from Java, the lack of OOM errors or GC problems has been a huge benefit of rust and I don’t ever see myself using any other programming language. I’m a big fan of the mindset “build it once, but build it the right way” which is why rust is always my choice.</p>

<p>Common arguments against Rust's safety guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li>The library you're binding to can have a segfault in it.</li>
<li>RAM can physically fail, causing dangling pointers.</li>
<li>The computer the Rust program is running on can be hit by a meteorite.</li>
<li>Alan Turing can come back from the dead and tell everyone that he actually made up computer science and none of it is real, thus invalidating every program ever made, including all Rust programs.</li>
